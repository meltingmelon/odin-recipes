<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Poke means “to slice” or “cut crosswise into pieces in Hawaiian. It refers to the raw fish that’s cut into cubes. It originated from Hawaiian fisherman who would season leftover parts of their catch for a snack! Poke is a Hawaiian-American food, but much of its flavor is influenced by Japanese cuisine: soy sauce, green onions, and sesame oil.</p>
